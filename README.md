# Vehicle Advertisement Machine Learning Project

Overview-
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to analyze and predict aspects of vehicle advertisements. 
The aim is to extract insights from vehicle data and apply predictive analytics, helping in better decision-making for vehicle listings.

Features-

Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns in the dataset.

Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Building: Implementation of various machine learning models.

Model Evaluation: Comparison of model performances using key evaluation metrics.

Prerequisites-

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.0, 
Pandas, 
Numpy, 
Scikit-learn, 
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations), 
Jupyter Notebook (for running .ipynb file), 

Install the required libraries:

Copy code- pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

How to Run the Project-
